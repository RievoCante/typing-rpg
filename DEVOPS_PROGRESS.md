# DevOps Learning Progress - Typing RPG

## ‚úÖ Completed Phases

### Phase 1: CI/CD Pipeline (Completed)

**What we implemented:**

- GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing
- Frontend CI: Lint and type-check on every PR
- Backend CI: Type-check and unit tests on every PR
- Backend CD: Auto-deploy to Cloudflare Workers on push to `main`
- Branch protection rules requiring CI checks to pass

**Skills learned:**

- GitHub Actions YAML syntax
- Secrets management (GitHub Secrets, Cloudflare tokens)
- Automated deployment pipelines
- Branch protection strategies

**Files created/modified:**

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- GitHub repository settings (branch protection)

---

### Phase 2: Automated Testing (Completed)

**What we implemented:**

- Unit tests for backend XP calculation system
- Vitest test framework setup
- Test coverage reporting
- Tests integrated into CI pipeline

**Skills learned:**

- Writing unit tests
- Test-driven development concepts
- Code coverage metrics
- Integration with CI/CD

**Files created/modified:**

- `backend/vitest.config.ts`
- `backend/src/core/xp.test.ts`
- `backend/package.json` (test scripts)

---

### Phase 3: Docker (Completed)

**What we implemented:**

- Frontend Dockerfile with multi-stage build
- Docker Compose for orchestration
- Environment variable management via `.env`
- Health checks for containers
- Production-ready Nginx configuration

**Skills learned:**

- Multi-stage Docker builds
- Docker Compose orchestration
- Container optimization (Alpine images, layer caching)
- Environment variable injection
- Container health checks

**Files created/modified:**

- `frontend/Dockerfile`
- `frontend/nginx.conf`
- `frontend/.dockerignore`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `.env` (root)

**Key decision:** Backend runs on host (Wrangler dev server), frontend runs in Docker

- Reason: Wrangler is designed for host execution, containerizing adds unnecessary complexity
- Production: Both are serverless (Cloudflare Pages + Workers)

---

### Phase 4: Git Workflow (Completed)

**What we mastered:**

- Feature branch workflow (`dev` ‚Üí `main`)
- Pull requests with required reviews
- Squash and merge strategy
- Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`)
- Branch synchronization and conflict resolution

**Skills learned:**

- Professional Git workflows
- Branch protection and merge strategies
- Conflict resolution
- Keeping branches in sync

---

## üöÄ Next Phase: Monitoring & Observability

### Why This Phase?

1. **High interview value** - "How do you monitor production systems?"
2. **Immediate practical value** - Catch errors in production
3. **Demonstrates proactive thinking** - Shows you think beyond deployment
4. **Easy to implement** - Can be done in 2-3 hours

### What We'll Implement:

#### 1. Error Tracking with Sentry

- Capture frontend and backend errors
- Track error rates and trends
- Get alerts for critical issues
- Performance monitoring

#### 2. Structured Logging

- Add logging middleware to backend
- Log request/response cycles
- Track performance metrics
- Easy debugging in production

#### 3. Analytics & Monitoring

- Cloudflare Analytics (already available!)
- Custom metrics (WPM stats, user engagement)
- Uptime monitoring
- Performance monitoring

#### 4. Alerting

- Email/Slack alerts for errors
- Threshold-based alerts
- Production incident response

### Estimated Time: 2-3 hours

### Job Interview Value: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

## Future Phases (After Monitoring)

### Phase 5: Security & Secrets Management

- GitHub Secrets audit
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Security headers
- CORS configuration review

### Phase 6: Infrastructure as Code

- Wrangler configuration management
- GitHub Actions as code
- Environment parity (dev/staging/prod)

### Phase 7: Performance Optimization

- Bundle size optimization
- CDN configuration
- Caching strategies
- Load testing

---

## Current Setup

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Backend (runs on host)
cd backend
bun run dev
# ‚Üí API available at http://localhost:8787

# Frontend (runs in Docker)
docker compose up
# ‚Üí Web app available at http://localhost:3000
```

### Production Deployment

- **Frontend**: Auto-deploy to Cloudflare Pages on push to `main`
- **Backend**: Auto-deploy to Cloudflare Workers on push to `main`
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite-based)

### Environment Variables

- **Root `.env`**: Frontend env vars for Docker build
- **GitHub Secrets**: API tokens for deployment
- **Cloudflare Environment Variables**: Production secrets

---

## Key Learnings

### Docker

- Multi-stage builds reduce image size (Node build ‚Üí Nginx serve)
- Alpine images are lightweight but may have compatibility issues
- Not every service needs to be containerized (Wrangler example)
- Health checks ensure service readiness

### CI/CD

- Automate everything that can be automated
- Fast feedback loops are crucial
- Branch protection prevents broken code in production
- Separate CI (testing) from CD (deployment)

### Testing

- Unit tests catch logic errors early
- Test coverage shows what's not tested
- Tests should run on every PR
- Good tests document expected behavior

### Git Workflow

- Feature branches keep `main` stable
- Squash commits for clean history
- Regular syncing prevents divergence
- Conventional commits improve readability

---

## DevOps Principles Applied

1. **Automation** - CI/CD, testing, deployment
2. **Version Control** - Everything in Git
3. **Continuous Integration** - Tests on every change
4. **Continuous Deployment** - Auto-deploy to production
5. **Infrastructure as Code** - Docker, GitHub Actions
6. **Monitoring** - Sentry error tracking ‚úÖ
7. **Collaboration** - PR workflow, branch protection

---

### Phase 5: Monitoring & Observability (Completed)

**What we implemented:**

- Sentry error tracking for frontend (React)
- Sentry error tracking for backend (Hono)
- Separate Sentry projects for frontend/backend
- Environment-based configuration
- Alert setup for proactive monitoring

**Skills learned:**

- Error tracking and monitoring concepts
- Sentry SDK integration
- Alert configuration
- Production debugging with full context
- Observability best practices

**Files created/modified:**

- `frontend/src/main.tsx` (Sentry initialization)
- `backend/src/index.ts` (Sentry middleware)
- `SENTRY_SETUP.md` (documentation)
- `.env` (VITE_SENTRY_DSN)
